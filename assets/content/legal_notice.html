        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>

        The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, we cannot guarantee the
        contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of the TMG <br>
        (Telemediengesetz -
        German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are liable for our content on these pages by general laws.
        However,
        according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service providers are not <br> obliged to monitor external
        information
        transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
        the
        use
        of information under general laws remain unaffected. <br> However, a liability in this regard is only possible
        from the
        moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content
        immediately.

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>

        Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control. Therefore, we cannot
        accept
        any
        liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the websites <br> is always
        responsible for
        the
        contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
        linking.
        Illegal contents were not identified at the time of linking. <br> However, permanent monitoring of the contents
        of the
        linked
        pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation. Upon notification of violations, we will
        remove
        such links immediately.

        <h2>Copyright</h2>

        The contents and works on these pages created by the site operator are subject to German copyright law. The
        duplication,
        processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright require <br> the written
        consent of
        the
        respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial
        use. In
        so far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, <br> the copyrights of third parties are
        respected.
        In
        particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you become aware of a copyright infringement, please
        inform us
        accordingly. Upon notification of violations, <br> we will remove such contents immediately. <br>
